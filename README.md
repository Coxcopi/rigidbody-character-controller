## About
This is a Godot 4.1 conversion of [Coxcopi](https://github.com/Coxcopi)'s rigid-body character controller that features walking, jumping, sprinting, sliding and crouching.
+ This project is using [Kenneys Prototype Textures](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/prototype-textures).
+ All Environment Textures/HDRIs are from [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/hdris).

##### Controls
- WASD - move
- Mouse - look around
- Ctrl - slide / crouch
- Shift - sprint

### Project Structure
The character scene and scripts are found in /Character/.
The testing scene (**Main.tscn**) was just randomly thrown together and is most likely no longer under development.
