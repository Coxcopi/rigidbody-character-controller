## About
This is a Character controller for the Godot game engine that features walking, jumping, sprinting, sliding and crouching.
This project is using [Kenneys Prototype Textures](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/prototype-textures) and the
[3D Text Plugin](https://github.com/SIsilicon/Godot-3D-text-plugin) made by [SIsilicon](https://github.com/SIsilicon).

### Project Structure
The character scene and scripts are found in /Character/.
The testing scene is just randomly thrown together and under development.
